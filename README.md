# fhir-schema-types

An npm-published set of TypeScript definitions for Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR).

## Installation and use

Install this into an existing TypeScript project with:

`npm install @automate-medical/fhir-schema-types`

The definitions are exported in the root level of the module, by version. You can import the latest _stable_ version by default. You can also import named versions.

```
import FHIR from '@automate-medical/fhir-schema-types'

import { R4 as FHIR } from '@automate-medical/fhir-schema-types'
```

You can also import specific versions.

`import { v4_6_0 as FHIR } from '@automate-medical/fhir-schema-types'`

This library exposes type and interface definitions in TypeScript for all of the elements and resources in FHIR. You can use it in your TypeScript projects to bring type-safety guarantees to your programs that manipulate FHIR documents. We wrote a custom JSON schema parser to achieve this, and to ensure maximum flexibility so that the project can be maintained into the future.

## Features & Roadmap

*Note* This project is semantically versioned. We make no commitments about the stability of our interfaces until 1.0.0.

- [X] Simple translation of JSON Schema definitions to `type` and `interface` definitions
- [X] Support for `const` values
- [ ] Support for using named `enum` types instead of `union` types that enumerate field options
- [ ] Support for `class` definitions instead of interfaces
- [ ] Public test suite/CICD
- [X] Support for version 4.0.1 (R4) and latest published 4.6.0
- [ ] Programatically download JSON Schema definitions for every version of FHIR and export schema
- [ ] Support definitions for the Graphql definitions provided in 4.6.0+
- [ ] Define a contributor license agreement
- [X] Publish NPM module
- [ ] NPM build should include a bundle + sourcemaps instead of the raw build

## Contributing

Building the project can be done with:

`npm run build`

At present, you must create a directory in the root of the project called `hl7`, inside of which you must create specific fhir.schema.json files for each of the versions you need to build. In the future, the project will download the assets itself.
